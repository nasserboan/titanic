# Titanic kaggle competition

___
Code for kaggle's Titanic classification problem and also used in a study group for ML newbies that I proudly help and try to pass my experience and knowledge. I've tried to keep the code here as simple as possible and noob-friendly.

Nice things in this code:

1. matplotlib subplots
2. matplotlib axvline
3. searborn swarmplot
4. SimpleInputer usage
5. GridSearchCV usage

## Changelog

v0 - First version - kaggle acc: 0.76076 - test acc: 0.83614

## ToDo

- Solve the same problem using neural networks
